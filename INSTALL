How to build, install and run rfc4938 client.

1) Build the pppoe-client:

  # ./configure --prefix=/usr && make install

2) Review the installed files

   Just focusing on the pppoe client files we should see the following installed files:

	sbin:
	  rfc4938pppoe
	  rfc4938ctl
	  rfc4938client

	etc/rfc4938client:
	  rfc4938.conf

	etc/init.d:
	  rfc4938clientd

3) View the config file paying close attention to the IFACE, NODE_ID, VIF_MODE and PLATFORM/TRANSPORT ENDPOINTS.

4) Now lets build the rfc4938 server namely "rp-pppoe-3.10-rfc4938". Note that the configure command
   resides in the src directory: ./configure --prefix=/$HOME/TESTDIR && make install

5) Edit /etc/ppp/pppoe-server-options as follows:
	lock
	noauth
	passive
	debug
	noipdefault
	nodeflate
	noccp
	nobsdcomp
	nopcomp
	ipcp-accept-local
	ipcp-accept-remote

6) The client can be started using the init script found in /etc/init.d or just use the simple command below:

	# ./rfc4938client -f CONFIG_FILE


7) The server scripts have not been tested yet and are a little compilcated, 
   instead the following command is used from the directory that contains 
   pppoe-server and the correct pppoe application provided by the rp-pppoe-3.10-rfc4938 installation:

	# ./pppoe-server -F -X -I $ETH_INTERFACE_NAME -S manet_radio -Q $FULL_PATH_TO_PPPOE -L 11.0.0.$NODE_ID
	# ./pppoe-server -F -X -I eth1 -S manet_radio -Q /home/jgiovatto/V0.9.x/sbin/pppoe   -L 11.0.0.1

  
  Notes: use ./pppoe-server --help to view all the command line options, used options explained below:
         the -F option keeps the aplication running in the foreground
         the -X option runs the server with rfc4938 flow control
         the -I option specifies the interface used to communicate w/client
         the -S option specifies the service name, this MUST match the SERVICE_NAME in the client conf.
         the -Q option specifies the full path to the pppoe application that supports rfc4938, there may
                be other non rfc4938 "pppoe" applications on the box from the standard distribution. Setting
                your PATH env variable will work also but the full path method is always safer.
         the -L option specifies the local ip ppp interface address, this MUST be different on each node.

8) Last start the emane platform making sure that the mac has enabled the following:
     <param name="flowcontrolenable"             value="on"/>
     <param name="radiometricenable"             value="on"/>
