How to build, install and run rfc4938 client.


1) Build the pppoe-client with subprocess rfc4938pppoe, pppoe-server with subprocess rfc4938pppoes rfc4938 mods:
  to build binaries/config for a local install, maybe the best bet until its verified to work
  # ./configure --prefix=/tmp/pppoe && make install

  to build packages for installing
  # ./configure && make rpm/deb


2) Review the installed files

   We should see the following installed files:

  # tree /tmp/pppoe

/tmp/pppoe/
├── etc
│   ├── init.d
│   │   └── rfc4938clientd
│   └── pppoe-client
│       └── rfc4938.conf
└── sbin
    ├── rfc4938client
    ├── rfc4938ctl
    ├── rfc4938pppoe
    ├── rfc4938pppoes
    └── rfc4938server


3) See letce2-pppoe for running the whole pppoe pile.
